Known bugs:

 * Fails to compile with very recent glibc (I will try to fix this soon)
 * Python bindings are currently broken because of the ABI change
 * ABI detection is not race safe. This should not be a problem for anyone,
   except when they're writing secure jails.

 * No BSD support yet. I will try a FreeBSD port sometime soon.
 * No support for <Arch>
 * No proper tests
