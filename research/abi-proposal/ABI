ABI Proposal
============

File layout
-----------

ABI information:

    arch/<arch_here>/arch.h

ABI detection:

    arch/<arch_here>/arch.c

Syscall definitions:

    arch/<arch_here>/syscalls.h

Generates syscall per abi:

    arch/<arch_here>/syscall_<ABI>.h

Events
------

The tracy_event structure will be modified with at least an extra variable
describing the current ABI of the event. This can then be used to determine if
the event is hooked; as well as when modifying or injecting system calls.

struct tracy_event {
    ...

    int abi;
}

Translating syscall numbers to/from strings
-------------------------------------------

get_syscall_{name,number} will take an additional argument: int abi.

Hooking
-------

A process is able to mix ABIs. There are several questions we need to tackle:

1) What events do we report (by default)?
2) What do we do with unreported events (by default)?

Reporting
*********

The API could be something like this:

    hook("write", func, TRACY_ABI_NATIVE);

And:

    hook("write", func, TRACY_ABI_ALL);

Rationale for TRACY_ABI_NATIVE as default:
    It is very hard to work with mixed ABIs, especially in the case with (for
    example) a 32 bit and 64 bit ABI. For this reason we believe it would be
    best to (by default) only stick to the native ABI for hooking / reporting.

Unreported Events
*****************

In the case that the programmer uses TRACY_ABI_NATIVE; and a non-native system
call is made, we need to decide what to do:

1) Do not report any event
2) Automagically "deny" the system call

Rationale for 1:
    Not reporting any events seems like the most sane option; as this is simply
    what the user specified; he only wanted NATIVE events.

Modification
------------

TODO: Add an ABI option for specifying the ABI. This will require either jumping
to our own code (meaning we have to inject some); or simply temporarily
overriding the instruction we are at (which is not safe, at all)
