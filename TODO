Tracy:

[X M ] Intercept system calls with ptrace(2)
[X M ] Hook system calls
[X M ] Read/Write system call arguments
[X MB] Inject system calls
[X M ] Modify (and deny) system calls
[/  B] Efficiently read(and write?) child memory. (Use mmap and shared memory)
[/  B] Efficiently share (allow read) memory with the child (Use mmap and shared
Memory)
[/ M ] Means to conveniently store data per child/pid. (void* in tracy_child)
[    ] (Optional) Attaching to running processes
[    ] (Optional) Trace children as well. Default on Linux, needs hacks to work
on *BSD, Solaris.

Soxy:

[/J  ] Working implementation of SOCKS 5 protocol
[ JMB] Hook some system calls, and perform required operations. We want to hook at
least: read(2), write(2), connect(2), getsockname(2), socket(2).
[ JMB] Keep track of FDs of sockets that we opened.
[ J  ] Implement IPv4 (IPv6 optional)
[ J  ] Implement TCP (UDP optional)
