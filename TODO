* Add python module (compiled from C, not ctypes; maybe a high level wrapper
around the C module, but no ctypes). For python API.
* Look at src/BROKEN_WITH_ABI and fix appropriately.
* Decide whether TRACY_HOOK_ABORT should kill all processes regardless if we
  started them or attached to them, or that it should detach ones that we
  attached to and kill the rest, etc...
* Add support for injection/modification with a different ABI than current.
* Add support for loading relocatable code in the binary. Some kind of modules?
  Would be awesome. Load dl in the process?
