Tracy:

[X M ] Intercept system calls with ptrace(2)
[X M ] Hook system calls
[X MB] Read/Write system call arguments
[X MB] Inject system calls
[X M ] Asynchronous system call injection.
[/ M ] Modify (and deny) system calls
[X  B] Efficiently read(and write?) child memory. (Use mmap and shared memory)
[/  B] Efficiently share (allow read) memory with the child (Use mmap and shared
Memory)
[X M ] Means to conveniently store data per child/pid. (void* in tracy_child)
[X  B] (Optional) Attaching to running processes
[X MB] (Optional) Trace children as well. Default on Linux, needs hacks to work
on *BSD, Solaris.
[  M ] Malkovich-ivy source.
[    ] Finish code that tests for fails. (Do we kill all childs on some
failures?)
[    ] Implement deny i.c.w. return code -ENOSYS, perhaps
``unimplement_syscall''?
[X  B] Add interrupt handler to tracy_main().
[    ] Documentation for tracy. (in sphinx and code)

Optional:
[    ] System call injection by signal. (Requires some changes to the injection
functions as we can't use the current value of the PC)

Soxy:

[/J  ] Working implementation of SOCKS 5 protocol
[ JMB] Hook some system calls, and perform required operations. We want to hook at
least: read(2), write(2), connect(2), getsockname(2), socket(2).
[ JMB] Keep track of FDs of sockets that we opened.
[ J  ] Implement support for IPv4 (IPv6 optional)
[ J  ] Implement support for TCP (UDP optional)
[  M ] Implement support for rule-based proxifying.
