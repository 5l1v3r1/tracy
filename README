Tracy, a system call tracer and injector
========================================

Presented is a uniform interface to trace the behaviour of programs
by means of the system calls they perform. Tracing by the user is done without
regard to kernel version, operating system or processor architecture.
The interface, called Tracy, provides a means to watch, modify, augment
and restrict program execution in a controlled environment.
